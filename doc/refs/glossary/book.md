    the designer and original implementor of
    {term}`C++`. The author of this

**D&E**
    {term}`Bjarne Stroustrup`：[The Design and Evolution of C++](https://stroustrup.com/dne.html). Addison Wesley. 1994. 一本书描述了为什么 C++ 看起来是这样的 —— 这是对 C++ 最接近于设计原理的书。

**C**
    [programming
    language](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#Gprogramming-language)
    designed and originally implemented by Dennis
    [Ritchie](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GRitchie).
    {term}`C++` is based on C and
    maintains a high degree of [compatibility with
    C](https://stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#C-is-subset). See also: [K&R
    C](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GK&R-C),
    [C89](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GC89),
    [C99](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GC99), [ANSI
    C](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GANSI-C). TC++PL B, D&E 3.12.

**C++**
    a [general-purpose programming
    language](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#Ggeneral-purpose-programming-language)
    with a bias towards systems programming that supports [procedural
    programming](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#Gprocedural-programming),
    [data
    abstraction](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#Gdata-abstraction),
    [object-oriented
    programming](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#Gobject-oriented-programming),
    and [generic
    programming](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#Ggeneric-programming).
    {term}`C`++ was designed and
    originally implemented by [Bjarne
    Stroustrup](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GBjarne-Stroustrup).
    C++ is defined by {term}`ISO`/IEC
    [14882](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#G14882) - Standard for the
    C++ Programming Language.
    [TC++PL](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GTC++PL#) describes C++
    and the fundamental techniques for its use. A description of the design
    considerations for C++ can be found in
    [D&E](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#GD&E#). Many commercial and
    [free implementations](https://stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#free) exist.
    TC++PL 1.3,-5, 2.1, D&E 0.

**ISO**
    the international standards organization. It defines and
    maintains the standards of the major non-proprietary [programming
    language](https://stroustrup.com/glossary.html#Gprogramming-language)s,
    notably {term}`C++`.
